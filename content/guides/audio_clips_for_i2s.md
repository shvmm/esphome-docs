.. audio_clips_for_i2s:


It is possible to create sound clips to include in your build to use with I²S speakers. No need for a media player component!

- Using [Audacity](https://github.com/audacity/audacity), convert audio to WAV, mono, 16kHz, Unsigned 8bit PCM

- Convert again, this time with [SOX](https://github.com/chirlu/sox).

```console
sox startup.wav --bits 8 --encoding signed-integer --endian little startup_again.raw

```
- Now convert it into a hexadecimal string using [xxd](https://github.com/ckormanyos/xxd) into a C++ file.

```console
xxd -i startup_again.raw startup.c

```
- The resulting file needs a modification in the start line:
  Open in an editor and change
  `unsigned char startup_again_raw[] = {…[SNIP]…}`
  to
  `std::vector<unsigned char> startup_raw = {…[SNIP]…}`.

Now you can rename the file to startup.h, put it inside the esphome configuration directory and put it in a include in your device config like this:

```yaml
esphome:
  includes:
    - startup.h

```
Now you can define using the audio clip using the following:

```yaml
- speaker.play:
    id: speaker
    data: !lambda return startup_raw;

```
Enjoy!

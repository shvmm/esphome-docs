This sensor allows you to use A01NYUB waterproof ultrasonic sensor by DFRobot
([datasheet](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/A01NYUB%20Waterproof%20Ultrasonic%20Sensor%20SKU:%20SEN0313))
with ESPHome to measure distances. This sensor can measure
ranges between 28 centimeters and 750 centimeters with a resolution of 1 milimeter.

Since this sensor reads multiple times per second, [Sensor Filters](#sensor-filters) are highly recommended.

To use the sensor, first set up an [UART Bus](#uart) with a baud rate of 9600 and connect the sensor to the specified pin.

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
sensor:
  - platform: "a01nyub"
    name: "Distance"

```
## Configuration variables:

- **uart_id** (*Optional*, [ID](#config-id)): The ID of the [UART bus](#uart) you wish to use for this sensor.
  Use this if you want to use multiple UART buses at once.
- All other options from [Sensor](#config-sensor).
